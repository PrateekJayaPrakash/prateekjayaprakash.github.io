## Project Description

**Project description:** Aguilliform robots are essentially eel-like robots designed for improved underwater agility and efficiency. By quantifying the motion into gaits, we can use the symmetry of the underlying Lie brackets to develop an outer loop feedback control to control the path of the robot.

### 1. Dynamic model of an eel

Planar Discrete Elastic Rod theory is used to develop a dynamic model of a flexible eel robot. The model assumes that the the links are flexible and massless. The nodes carry all the mass, and consequently, the forces that act on the robot. We use a simplified fluid force model by [Kelasidi et. al](site it) to calculate the dynamic fluid force acting on the nodes. The flexible links experience a force due to relative stretching and bending which interact with the fluid forces to generate motion.

### 2.Quantifying motion into gaits

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Motion as a combination of gaits
