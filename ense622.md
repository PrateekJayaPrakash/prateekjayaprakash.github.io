## Project Description

**Analysis Objective:** The goal of the trade-off analysis is to determine which design option for the e-bike has the best combination of high reliability, long range, and low cost.

### 2. Modeling and Simulation approach
Analytical models for Cost, Reliability, and Range of the E-bike were developed. A Multi-Attribute Value Function (MAVF) analysis was performed to determine the best design option. Then, a Sensitivity Analysis was performed to assess the effect of uncertainty in the MAVF Analysis results due to the uncertainty in the design factor values. Monte Carlo simulations were performed on the Reliability and Range models to evaluate the uncertainties in the range and reliability of the system which were the inputs to the Sensitivity Analysis.


### 3. System Description
The E-Bike is a personal transportation vehicle which consists of an electric propulsion system fitted to a bicycle chassis. Figure 1 depicts a System Block Definition Diagram of the E-bike System with its environment. The following are the principal components of the E-bike system:

1.	Rider/ User: The rider/user of the system is the person who is riding the E-bike for his/her daily commute. For the purpose of  analysis, we have considered the rider to be an adult with a body weight of 80kg (176.36 lbs.).

2.	Chassis: The Chassis is the main structural component of the E-bike and all the systems components are attached to it. For the purpose of the analysis, we have considered a chassis made of steel which weighs 25 kg.

3.	Battery Package: The battery package consists of the battery, charge controller, discharge controller, and the wiring harness. The battery is used as the primary power source to propel the E-bike forward. For the purpose of the analysis, we have considered batteries with the same energy capacity of 1440 Wh.

4.	Motor Package: The motor package includes the motor, its wiring harness, and the motor controller. The motor provides the necessary torque to drive the wheels of the E-bike. We are considering 48V 1000W motors for this analysis.

The environmental factors that affect the E-bike system performance are:

1.	Wind

2.	Terrain surface resistance

3.	Terrain Gradient or slope
