## Project Description

**Project Objective:** To Model an underwater snake robot based on PDER framework and develop feedback control algorithms to control the trajectory of the robot.

### 1. Why elastic links?

Traditionally, robots are made of rigid links with angular control of node angles. With this framework, there is a major restriction on the 
rigidity of the robot and contact forces are difficult to model. 
By using elastic links with direct control on the shape of the robot, we can achieve the same goal of locomotion with additional advantages.
1. Elastic links allow for an inbuild pneumatic buayancy controller where the buoyancy can be varied by pumping air into the flexible   links.
2. Elastic links offer a wide range of applications in search and rescue operations. (Ability to access tight areas)

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
